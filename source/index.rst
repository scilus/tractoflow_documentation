Welcome to the TractoFlow user documentation!
=============================================

.. note::
    New release available: 2.4.2.

TractoFlow pipeline is developed by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (`SCIL`_)
in order to process diffusion MRI dataset from the raw data to the tractography.
The pipeline is based on Nextflow and Singularity. The goal with this pipeline
is to be fast and reproducible.
